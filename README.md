- 👋 Hi, I’m @SkyGuy29
- 👀 I’m young and interested in Computer Science, hopefully for long enough to stick with it long term.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a half-decent programmer (in C++ for now)
  - Two-time SFML aracade game recreation project leader for our high school programming classes (Aero Fighters and Joust)
